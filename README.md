WebGameChallenge
================

I've challenged @abidraja to make a "HTML5 Game." Just for fun.

Disclaimer: I only know basic HTML and "Document.getElementById()" in Javascript. Don't expect much (or anything really).

We have until midnight PST (about 2 hours, but I'm more than a little late).
